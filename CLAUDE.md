# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Obsidian vault for documenting machine learning learnings and research. The vault contains daily notes with curated links to videos, articles, and resources about various ML/AI topics including:

- AI agents and multi-agent workflows
- Neural networks (CNNs, GANs, Transformers)
- Memory systems for AI applications
- Development tools and frameworks
- Research papers and tutorials

## Vault Structure

The vault follows a simple daily note structure:
- **Daily Notes**: Files named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` containing learning resources for that day
- **No Folders**: All notes are stored in the root directory for easy access
- **Content Format**: Each note contains YouTube video embeds and links to relevant resources

## Obsidian Configuration

The vault uses standard Obsidian features:
- **File Explorer**: For navigating daily notes
- **Search**: For finding specific topics across all notes
- **Backlinks/Outgoing Links**: For discovering connections between topics
- **Tags**: For categorizing content (though not heavily used currently)
- **Git Integration**: Via obsidian-git plugin for version control

## Working with Content

When adding or organizing content:
- Follow the daily note naming convention (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`)
- Include descriptive titles for YouTube videos using the `![Title](URL)` format
- Add direct links to articles, documentation, and tools
- Keep content focused on ML/AI learning resources
- Use the existing simple format - no complex templating needed

## Note Organization

Content is organized chronologically by date rather than by topic. This allows for:
- Easy tracking of learning progression over time
- Natural discovery of related topics through Obsidian's linking features
- Simple maintenance without complex folder structures

## Common Topics Covered

Based on existing notes, the vault covers:
- **AI Development Tools**: Claude Code, Cursor, LangChain
- **Neural Network Architectures**: CNNs, GANs, Transformers
- **Agent Systems**: Multi-agent workflows, memory systems
- **Educational Resources**: Tutorial videos, research papers
- **Development Frameworks**: Various ML/AI libraries and tools
