## Agent Memory Systems Research

Conducted comprehensive research on memory systems for AI agents, covering both solo and multi-agent architectures. See [[research/agent-memory-systems]] for detailed analysis.

### Key Findings

**Memory Architecture Types**:
- Short-term working memory vs long-term persistent storage
- Episodic memory for experiences vs semantic memory for knowledge
- Procedural memory for skills and behaviors

**Implementation Approaches**:
- Vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB) for similarity-based retrieval
- Hybrid architectures combining multiple storage types
- Memory-augmented generation (RAG) for LLM integration

**Multi-Agent Memory Systems**:
- Shared memory architectures with role-based access control
- Collaborative memory formation and knowledge validation
- Memory synchronization protocols for distributed systems

**Recent Breakthroughs (2024-2025)**:
- Infinite context systems handling millions of tokens
- Human-inspired cognitive architectures with emotional memory
- Enterprise validation showing 70% improvement in multi-agent success rates

### Connections Established

Updated [[research/connection-map]] to reflect memory systems as a cognitive foundation connecting:
- **[[multi-agent-systems]]**: Shared memory for collaboration
- **[[neural-networks]]**: LLM integration with external memory
- **[[reinforcement-learning-agents]]**: Persistent learning from experience
- **[[vector-databases]]**: Technical storage infrastructure

### Tools & Frameworks

**Open Source**: LangChain Memory, AutoGen Memory, ChromaDB, MemGPT
**Commercial**: Pinecone, Weaviate, OpenAI Assistants API, Anthropic Claude Memory
**Emerging**: Neo4j Vector Search, MongoDB Atlas Vector Search, Redis Memory

This research provides a comprehensive foundation for understanding how agents create, manage, and curate memory across different architectures and use cases.
