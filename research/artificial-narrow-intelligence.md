# Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)

## Overview

==Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)== represents the current paradigm of AI systems designed to excel at **specific, well-defined tasks** within limited domains. Unlike general intelligence, ANI systems demonstrate ==superhuman performance== in their specialized areas while remaining fundamentally constrained to their training objectives and data distributions.

> [!info] Definition
> ANI refers to AI systems that can perform specific tasks at or above human-level performance but lack the flexibility to transfer knowledge across different domains or adapt to novel situations outside their training scope.

## Core Characteristics

### Technical Foundations

==ANI systems== are characterized by several key technical properties:

- **Domain Specificity**: Optimized for particular tasks or narrow problem sets
- **Training Distribution Dependence**: Performance degrades when encountering data outside training distributions
- **Task-Specific Architecture**: Neural network architectures tailored to specific problem domains
- **Limited Transfer Learning**: Minimal ability to apply learned knowledge to different domains

> [!note] Key Insight
> ANI systems achieve their exceptional performance through ==deep specialization== rather than broad intelligence, often surpassing human capabilities within their narrow domains.

### Performance Characteristics

Current ANI systems demonstrate remarkable capabilities:

- **Medical Imaging**: ==95%+ accuracy== in diagnostic tasks (mammography, radiology)
