# Research Rules and Methodology

## Purpose
This document establishes standardized rules for conducting research on machine learning topics, discovering similar content, and creating meaningful connections within the Obsidian second brain system.

## Research Workflow

### 1. Topic Discovery Process
Before researching a new topic:
1. **Search Existing Content**: Use Obsidian search to find related topics in daily notes
2. **Check News Archives**: Review `/news/` folder for relevant AI agent developments
3. **Identify Gaps**: Determine what aspects haven't been covered yet
4. **Plan Connections**: Note potential links to existing content

### 2. Research Agent Instructions

#### For ML/AI Topics (General)
```
Research the topic "[TOPIC_NAME]" with focus on:
1. Core concepts and technical foundations
2. Recent developments and breakthroughs (2024-2025)
3. Practical applications and use cases
4. Key researchers, papers, and resources
5. Connections to other ML/AI domains
6. Learning resources (videos, tutorials, documentation)

Provide findings in format suitable for Obsidian vault integration with:
- Clear explanations for learning purposes
- Source links for further exploration
- Connections to related topics already covered
- Practical implementation examples where relevant
```

#### For AI Agents Specifically
Use the existing `/news/rules.md` template for agent-focused research.

### 3. Content Integration Strategy

#### Creating Connections
1. **Backlink Strategy**: Use `[[Topic Name]]` format for connecting related concepts
2. **Tag System**: Apply consistent tags like `#neural-networks`, `#agents`, `#frameworks`
3. **Cross-References**: Add "Related Topics" sections in research notes
4. **Temporal Linking**: Connect concepts that build upon each other chronologically

#### File Organization
- **Research Notes**: Store in `/research/topic-name.md` format
- **Daily Integration**: Reference research in daily notes with links
- **Update Existing**: Enhance previous daily notes with new connections discovered

### 4. Second Brain Connection Framework

#### Discovery Methods
1. **Keyword Search**: Use Obsidian's search for concept overlap
2. **Graph View**: Visualize connections between topics
3. **Tag Exploration**: Find related content through shared tags
4. **Chronological Review**: Identify how topics evolved over time in daily notes

#### Connection Types
- **Foundational**: Basic concepts that support advanced topics
- **Evolutionary**: How topics develop and improve over time
- **Complementary**: Topics that work together or solve similar problems
- **Contrasting**: Different approaches to similar challenges

### 5. Quality Standards

#### Research Depth
- **Primary Sources**: Link to original papers, documentation, official sites
- **Multiple Perspectives**: Include various viewpoints and approaches
- **Current Relevance**: Focus on 2024-2025 developments when possible
- **Educational Value**: Prioritize learning and understanding over news

#### Connection Quality
- **Meaningful Links**: Only connect topics with genuine relationships
- **Bi-directional**: Ensure connections work both ways conceptually
- **Context Explanation**: Briefly explain why topics are connected
- **Progressive Building**: Connect simpler concepts to more complex ones

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create Research Files
- Complex topics requiring deep exploration
- Subjects spanning multiple daily notes
- Concepts with many interconnections
- Topics needing structured learning paths

### When to Use Daily Notes Only
- Simple resource sharing
- Single video or article discussion
- Brief updates or news items
- Casual learning observations

### Connection Discovery Triggers
- Encountering similar terminology across topics
- Finding repeated authors or researchers
- Noticing shared mathematical foundations
- Identifying common application domains
- Discovering overlapping implementation approaches

## Integration with Existing System

### With Daily Notes
- Reference research files in daily notes using `[[research/topic-name]]`
- Create daily entries that build upon research foundations
- Use research files as "index pages" for scattered daily content

### With News System
- Connect AI agent news to broader ML research topics
- Reference news developments in topic research files
- Use news insights to update and expand research content

### With Obsidian Features
- **Graph View**: Visualize topic relationships and clusters
- **Search**: Find hidden connections across all content
- **Tags**: Create topic hierarchies and category systems
- **Backlinks**: Track which content references each research topic
