# UV Python Package Manager

## Overview
==UV is an extremely fast Python package and project manager written in Rust by Astral== (creators of Ruff), serving as a revolutionary replacement for traditional Python package management tools. UV represents an intermediary milestone toward creating a "Cargo for Python" - a unified tool that combines the functionality of pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, and more into a single, high-performance solution.

> [!note] Key Innovation
> UV achieves ==10-100x speed improvements== over traditional package managers through its Rust implementation, making it the fastest Python package manager available in 2025.

## Key Concepts

- **==Unified Tool==**: Single replacement for pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, and more
- **==Rust Performance==**: Written in Rust for exceptional speed - ==80x faster than python -m venv== and ==7x faster than virtualenv==
- **==Standards Compliant==**: Fully compatible with existing pip ecosystem, requirements.txt files, and package indexes
- **==Project Management==**: Complete project lifecycle management with pyproject.toml and lock files
- **==Virtual Environment Automation==**: Automatic environment creation and management without manual activation

## Performance Benefits

### Speed Improvements
- **Package Resolution**: ==8-10x faster than pip and pip-tools== without caching
- **Cached Operations**: ==80-115x faster== when running with a warm cache
- **Environment Creation**: ==80x faster than python -m venv== and ==7x faster than virtualenv==
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: ==40% faster== execution in automated environments
- **Parallel Installation**: Installs packages in parallel, skipping traditional wheel-building step

> [!tip] Performance Architecture
> UV's speed comes from its innovative Rust architecture, efficient dependency resolution algorithms, and parallel processing capabilities that traditional Python-based tools cannot match.

### Efficiency Gains
- **Dependency Resolution**: Resolves packages in seconds rather than minutes
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Resolves hanging dependencies automatically during project locks
- **Resource Usage**: Minimal memory footprint and CPU usage
- **Network Optimization**: Optimized package downloading and caching strategies

## Project Setup and Structure

cd my-project

# Initialize in existing directory
uv init .
```

### Core Commands

uv remove openai

# Sync environment with lockfile
uv sync

# Run commands in project environment
uv run python script.py
uv run pytest
uv run django-admin startproject

# Lock dependencies
uv lock

# List installed packages
uv pip list
```

## Dependency Management

### pyproject.toml Configuration
```toml
[project]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Python project managed by UV"
requires-python = ">=3.10"
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.31.0",
    "pydantic>=2.0.0",
    "python-dotenv>=1.0.0",
]

[project.optional-dependencies]
dev = [
    "pytest>=7.0.0",
    "black>=23.0.0",
    "ruff>=0.1.0",
    "mypy>=1.0.0",
]
test = [
    "pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0",
    "pytest-mock>=3.10.0",
    "coverage>=7.0.0",
]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
    "jupyter>=1.0.0",
    "ipython>=8.0.0",
]
```

### Lock File System
- **==uv.lock==**: Captures exact versions of all dependencies (direct and transitive)
- **==Reproducible Builds==**: Ensures consistent environments across machines and deployments
- **==Automatic Updates==**: Lock file automatically updated when dependencies change
- **==Version Pinning==**: Prevents dependency conflicts and version drift

> [!info] Lock File Benefits
> UV's lock file system ensures that all team members and deployment environments use identical package versions, eliminating "works on my machine" issues.

## Virtual Environment Handling

### Automatic Environment Management
```bash
# UV automatically creates and manages .venv directories
# No manual activation required - UV handles environment switching

# Environment is automatically activated for:
uv run python script.py      # Running scripts
uv run pytest               # Running tests
uv add new-package          # Adding packages
uv sync                     # Syncing dependencies
```

### Environment Features
- **==Standards Compliant==**: Creates standard virtual environments compatible with other tools
- **==Automatic Activation==**: No need for manual `source .venv/bin/activate`
- **==Project Isolation==**: Each project gets its own isolated environment
- **==Python Version Management==**: Handles multiple Python versions seamlessly

## Project Best Practices

### Installation and Setup
```bash
# Install tools using UV
uv tool install black
uv tool install ruff

# Or add to existing project
uv add requests beautifulsoup4

# Create new project
uv init my-workflow
cd my-workflow
uv add 'pydantic>=2.0.0'
```

### Configuration Management
```python
# src/my_project/config.py
from pydantic import BaseSettings
from typing import Dict, Any

class AppConfig(BaseSettings):
    """Configuration for Python project using Pydantic for validation."""
    
    api_key: str
    app_verbose: bool = True
    max_connections: int = 10
    timeout: int = 300
    
    class Config:
        env_file = ".env"
        env_file_encoding = "utf-8"
```

## CI/CD Integration

# Copy source code
COPY src/ ./src/

# Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app/src

# Run the application
CMD ["uv", "run", "python", "src/main.py"]
```

## Advanced UV Commands

### Project Management
```bash
# Create project with specific Python version
uv init --python 3.11 my-project

# Add dependencies with constraints
uv add 'django>=4.0,<5.0'
uv add 'requests>=2.31.0'

# Add development dependencies
uv add pytest black ruff --dev

# Install optional dependency groups
uv sync --all-extras
uv sync --extra dev
uv sync --extra test

# Export requirements for compatibility
uv export --format requirements-txt --output-file requirements.txt
```

### Environment Management
```bash
# Use specific Python version
uv python install 3.11
uv python pin 3.11

# Clean environment
uv sync --reinstall

# Remove unused dependencies
uv sync --exact

# Show dependency tree
uv tree

# Check for outdated packages
uv pip list --outdated
```

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Platform Support
- **==Linux==**: Full support with native performance
- **==macOS==**: Native ARM64 and x86_64 support
- **==Windows==**: Complete Windows support with PowerShell integration
- **==Docker==**: Optimized for containerized environments

### Python Version Management
```bash
# Install and manage Python versions
uv python install 3.11 3.12
uv python list
uv python pin 3.11  # Pin version for project

# Use in pyproject.toml
[project]
requires-python = ">=3.10,<3.14"
```

> [!tip] Python Version Management
> UV automatically handles Python version constraints defined in pyproject.toml and will warn about incompatibilities during dependency resolution.

## Migration from Other Tools

### From Poetry
```bash
# UV can read existing pyproject.toml files
# Simply replace poetry commands with uv equivalents:

# Poetry -> UV equivalents
poetry install     -> uv sync
poetry add pkg     -> uv add pkg
poetry run cmd     -> uv run cmd
poetry shell       -> (automatic with uv run)
poetry build       -> uv build
```

### From pip + requirements.txt
```bash
# Convert requirements.txt to pyproject.toml
uv init
uv add --requirements requirements.txt

# Or import directly
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### From conda
```bash
# Create UV project from conda environment
conda list --export > conda-requirements.txt
uv init
# Manually convert conda packages to pip equivalents
uv add package1 package2 package3
```
