# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Overview
==Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)== is a technique that combines pre-trained language models with external knowledge retrieval to generate more accurate and factual responses. It addresses the limitation of LLMs having outdated or incomplete knowledge by dynamically fetching relevant information from external sources during generation.

> [!note] Key Insight
> RAG bridges the gap between static model knowledge and dynamic, up-to-date information, making it essential for applications requiring current or domain-specific knowledge.

## Key Concepts
- **Vector Retrieval**: Converting documents and queries into ==embeddings== for semantic similarity search
- **Knowledge Base**: External corpus of documents, databases, or APIs that provide contextual information
- **Augmented Prompting**: Injecting retrieved context into prompts before generation to improve accuracy
- **Hybrid Search**: Combining semantic similarity with keyword-based search for better retrieval results

## Applications & Use Cases
- **Customer Support**: Accessing up-to-date documentation and policies for accurate responses
- **Research Assistance**: Pulling from scientific papers and databases for evidence-based answers
- **Enterprise Knowledge**: Integrating company-specific documents and internal wikis into AI systems
- **Legal Analysis**: Referencing current laws, regulations, and case precedents

> [!info] Current State
> RAG has become the dominant pattern for production LLM applications, with major frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex built specifically to support RAG workflows.

## Recent Developments
- **Advanced Retrieval**: ==Hybrid search== combining dense and sparse retrieval methods (2024)
- **Multi-hop RAG**: Iterative retrieval for complex questions requiring multiple information sources
- **GraphRAG**: Using ==knowledge graphs== to improve retrieval accuracy and reasoning
- **Agentic RAG**: Integration with AI agents for more sophisticated information gathering workflows
