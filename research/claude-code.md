# Claude Code

## Overview
Claude Code is Anthropic's AI-powered command-line interface designed for terminal-based development workflows. It provides comprehensive codebase understanding with 200K token context windows and emphasizes multi-file operations, making it particularly strong for complex refactoring and architectural changes compared to IDE-based alternatives.

## Key Concepts
- **Terminal-First Architecture**: Designed specifically for command-line workflows rather than IDE integration, enabling seamless integration with existing developer toolchains
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Revolutionary system for connecting to external tools like GitHub, Slack, databases, and custom developer tooling
- **Large Context Understanding**: 200K token capacity enabling comprehensive understanding of entire codebases and complex project relationships

## Applications & Use Cases
- **Full-Stack Development**: End-to-end application development with sophisticated multi-file coordination and dependency tracking
- **Legacy Code Migration**: Automated modernization and refactoring of existing codebases with comprehensive understanding of interconnections
- **Code Review and Security Analysis**: Intelligent vulnerability detection and comprehensive code quality assessment across entire projects
- **Documentation and Testing**: Automated generation of comprehensive documentation and intelligent test suite development with coverage optimization

## Recent Developments
**Enterprise Market Growth (2024-2025)**: Anthropic's market share in AI coding assistants doubled from 12% to 24%, driven by Claude Code's superior multi-file understanding and enterprise-focused reliability features. Performance improvements include 40% faster code generation and enhanced security vulnerability detection.
