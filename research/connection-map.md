## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Connections
1. Identify the connection type (foundational/evolutionary/complementary/contrasting)
2. Verify the connection exists in actual content
3. Add to appropriate cluster or create new cluster
4. Update navigation helpers if needed

### Reviewing Existing Connections
- Quarterly review of connection accuracy
- Update based on new content additions
- Remove connections that no longer reflect vault content
- Strengthen weak connections with additional research

### Graph View Optimization
- Use this map to identify overly connected or isolated topics
- Balance connection density across different areas
- Ensure bidirectional conceptual relationships
