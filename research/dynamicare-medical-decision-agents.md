# DynamiCare: Dynamic Multi-Agent Framework for Medical Decision-Making

## Overview
DynamiCare introduces the first dynamic multi-agent framework specifically designed for interactive, open-ended medical decision-making, modeling clinical diagnosis as multi-round interactive loops that mirror real-world healthcare processes. The framework establishes new standards for LLM-powered clinical decision support through adaptive specialist coordination and iterative diagnostic refinement.

## Key Concepts
- **Interactive Diagnostic Loops**: Multi-round patient-doctor interactions where information is gradually revealed and diagnostic hypotheses are iteratively refined
- **Dynamic Agent Coordination**: Central Agent managing specialist teams that adapt composition based on Visit Logs and interaction history
- **Patient System Simulation**: Realistic patient responses generated from structured electronic health record data enabling authentic clinical scenarios
- **Adaptive Reasoning Strategies**: Specialist agents modify their approach based on emerging patient information and collaborative insights
- **MIMIC-Patient Dataset**: Structured benchmark derived from MIMIC-III EHR data specifically designed for dynamic clinical decision-making evaluation

## Applications & Use Cases
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Real-time diagnostic assistance for healthcare providers through multi-specialist consultation simulation
- **Medical Education**: Training platforms for medical students and residents using realistic patient interaction scenarios
- **Differential Diagnosis**: Complex diagnostic reasoning where multiple specialists collaborate to reach accurate conclusions
- **Telemedicine Enhancement**: AI-powered systems supporting remote consultations with sophisticated diagnostic capabilities
- **Healthcare Quality Assurance**: Systematic evaluation of diagnostic processes and identification of potential improvement areas

## Recent Developments
The July 2025 publication (arXiv:2507.02616) by Tianqi Shang and colleagues represents the first systematic approach to modeling clinical diagnosis as dynamic, interactive processes rather than single-turn question-answering systems. The framework addresses critical limitations in current medical AI by embracing uncertainty, iterative reasoning, and collaborative decision-making patterns that characterize actual clinical practice.

## Technical Architecture

### Dual System Design
The framework consists of two primary components working in concert:

**Patient System**: 
- Responds to medical queries with contextual information from patient data
- Generates realistic patient responses based on EHR structured data
- Simulates natural information revelation patterns observed in clinical practice
- Maintains consistency across multiple interaction rounds

**Doctor System**:
- Central Agent coordinates specialist team composition and diagnostic strategy
- Dynamic specialist team adaptation based on Visit Logs and interaction history
- Iterative hypothesis generation, testing, and refinement processes
- Collaborative reasoning integration across multiple medical specialties

### Visit Log Integration
The innovative Visit Log system records comprehensive interaction history, enabling agents to:
- Track diagnostic hypothesis evolution over multiple consultation rounds
- Adapt questioning strategies based on previous patient responses
- Maintain coherent reasoning chains across extended diagnostic processes
- Support complex medical scenarios requiring prolonged investigation

### Clinical Realism
DynamiCare's emphasis on multi-round, interactive diagnostic processes addresses fundamental limitations in existing medical AI systems that assume complete case information availability. The framework models the inherent uncertainty and iterative nature of clinical diagnosis, better aligning with actual healthcare provider decision-making patterns and supporting more sophisticated clinical reasoning capabilities.
