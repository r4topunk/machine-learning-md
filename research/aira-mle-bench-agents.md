# AIRA: AI Research Agents for Machine Learning

## Overview
AIRA (AI Research Agents) represents a breakthrough in automated machine learning research by formalizing AI research agents as graph-based search algorithms that systematically navigate solution spaces. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-bench with a 47.7% medal success rate, establishing new standards for autonomous ML research systems.

## Key Concepts
- **Graph-based Search Framework**: Treats AI research as systematic navigation through solution spaces using structured operators
- **AIRA-dojo Environment**: Isolated compute resources (1 H200 GPU, 24 CPU cores, 100 GB RAM) within Apptainer containers for safe agent execution
- **Core Operators**: Five specialized operators (Draft, Debug, Improve, Memory, Crossover) enhanced with dynamic complexity cues and "Think Tokens"
- **Search Policies**: Systematic evaluation of Greedy, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and Evolutionary algorithms for optimal performance
- **Scoped Memory**: Context-aware memory extraction mechanisms that adapt based on operator requirements

## Applications & Use Cases
- **Automated ML Engineering**: Complete Kaggle competition workflows including model training, dataset preparation, and experimental design
- **Scientific Discovery Automation**: Systematic exploration of ML research problems with minimal human intervention
- **Benchmark Evaluation**: Real-world performance assessment through 24-hour constrained Kaggle competition environments
- **Research Methodology**: Template for formalizing autonomous research agents across scientific domains

## Recent Developments
The July 2025 publication introduces revolutionary operator-centric design where performance bottlenecks lie primarily in operator sophistication rather than search policy optimization. The framework addresses systematic overfitting in search processes through novel generalization techniques and establishes MLE-bench Lite as the gold standard for evaluating AI research agents with 22 curated Kaggle competitions testing practical ML engineering skills.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
The AIRA framework separates search policies from operators, enabling systematic exploration of agent design spaces. The five core operators work synergistically:

- **Draft**: Initial solution generation with structured reasoning
- **Debug**: Error identification and correction mechanisms
- **Improve**: Iterative solution enhancement and optimization
- **Memory**: Context-aware information retrieval and storage
- **Crossover**: Solution combination and hybrid approach generation

### Search Strategy Integration
The interplay between search strategy and operator design proves critical for performance, with the framework demonstrating that sophisticated operators significantly outweigh search policy optimizations. This insight reshapes how autonomous research systems should be architected.

### Evaluation Methodology
MLE-bench Lite provides rigorous real-world testing through Kaggle competition scenarios, measuring practical ML engineering capabilities rather than isolated algorithmic performance. The 24-hour constraint mirrors realistic research timelines while the medal achievement metric ensures meaningful evaluation standards.
